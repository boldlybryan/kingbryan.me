Interested in chatting? Feel free to reach out and say what's up! I'm usually pretty good about checking my Twitter, follow me (I'm [@kingbryandotme](https://twitter.com/kingbryandotme)), then shoot me a DM or just mention me and I'll reply ASAP. If you're looking to check out some of my open source work, I'm [kingbryan](https://github.com/kingbryan) on GitHub. Please take a look and let me know what you think.

Maybe you'd like to get me to work on a project with you? That's great! I've created this little form for you to provide some more information. It'll end up in my inbox and I'll know you're interested in working together. I do my best to get back to inquiries within a day or so.
