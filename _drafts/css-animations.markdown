title: Getting started with CSS animations
---
Seeing some of the creations other developers make with CSS animations is astounding. Sure, they're technically websites, but I'd say they're artistic masterpieces. The first time I saw one, I was convinced someone had made it in some fancy Adobe product. To my surprise, these beautiful animations were totally achievable to anyone who had basic web development skills.

Up until last week, I had absolutely no idea how CSS animations worked. I've always been curious, but figured it was way over my head. I'd browse the top pens on Codepen and check out their source code. At a glance, it looks super difficult, and it can be. But with a little bit of patience and willingness to build something awesome, you can make your HTML move with CSS!

First, if you haven' already, take a look at [some CSS animations on Codepen](http://codepen.io/search/pens?q=animations&limit=all&order=popularity&depth=everything&show_forks=false). A few of my personal favorites are ____ , ____, & ____.
