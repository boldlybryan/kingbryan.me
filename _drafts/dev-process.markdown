title: Development processes
---
I would imagine that to many self-trained developers, many SDLC formalities are very foreign. I know that they were for me. The words agile and waterfall were thrown around loosely in some of my college classes. They were typically a slide a piece in a Powerpoint deck, only talked about once so that it could be a question on a test. Admittedly, these weren't development classes, but courses designed to make a solid business analyst. The couple of web development classes I did take didn't even touch on these processes. Instead, the instructors worried only about the fundamentals of making a website function. Sure, we did projects, even in groups, but there was never any organization to it.

Beyond two of those classes, I acquired my knowledge via the Internet or co-workers in a very informal way. Before starting my first job, I didn't have any process. I worked alone, really just hacking sites together with my limited skill set. It didn't require any organization, but it really should have been. The problem is that there aren't really any resources to learn these things. You just have to practice them and figure it out as you go along.

I'm sure many people who work alone don't follow much of a structure either. And that's not entirely bad. Whatever works for an individual is what they should do. But what happens when a second person is brought in? A whole team of developers? Very quickly, there has to become some sort of standard for how work is completed.

When I joined the team I work with, I knew nothing about Agile, other than it was a SDLC practice. I'd never thought of a formal testing process. I didn't have anyone to perform a code review for me or me for them. I didn't ensure that everything worked well across multiple platforms and several testing environments.

Stepping into this situation helped me grow more than I could have imagined. And the best part is I still suck at it. I could be doing so much better at reviewing and testing code. Currently, our team is working to evolve our own processes to help us be more efficient. We've released some bugs that could've been avoided if we'd been more careful.
