# Fixing the ad-blocking problem
* quality of content needs to improve
  * people would be more willing to pay for better material.
* Ads need to be less obtrusive
  * Privacy concerns with tracking users
  * Ads become annoying and detract from user experience
* Ads are necessary to keep the web alive
  * cannot expect people to produce things for free
  * ads & sponsorships have worked for decades in other forms of media
