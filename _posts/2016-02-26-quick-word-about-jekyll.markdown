title: A quick word about Jekyll

This week, I want to talk about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), which is the tool I am using to create this website. Jekyll provides an easy way to author content in text files or even straight from a command line. As they say on their website: "Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator." Let's dive into the details!

Jekyll is one of the simplest ways to create and maintain a website. There's no complicated interface or intense learning curve to getting started. Essentially, Jekyll is a Ruby program that takes plain text (written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)) and places it into HTML templates. All content lives in a single directory, and when the site is compiled, the content is placed on the page.

The structure provided by Jekyll makes publishing many pieces of content, like blog posts, a breeze. While a traditional CMS like Wordpress uses a database to store content, Jekyll relies on easy-to-use text files instead. I've found it much easier to manage a blog without all the extra fluff of Wordpress. To me, Jekyll is much less distracting to use. If I'm writing a post, it's just me and my text editor. I don't have the need for a shiny interface with lots of bells and whistles. I don't want to go wild installing bad plugins to decrease my site's performance. But what I do want is complete control over everything that goes on my site, and Jekyll makes that easier than most.

It seems like the web development community agrees, as many of us have implemented Jekyll for our sites. In fact, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) uses Jekyll as the platform to give users the ability to host a site for free! Plenty of open source projects use Jekyll, like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com). There are even design teams that use it for developing style guides for projects, as [Facebook's design team does.](https://facebook.github.io/design/). It's super flexible and has seemingly infinite use cases. Even if you aren't super technical, I recommend giving it a try. They have some great documentation and a supportive community.

I expect that I will explore Jekyll in future posts. There is still a ton of work to finish on my site, and I'll document interesting tidbits I learn as I go. In the meantime, I'll be chipping away at my [to-do list](https://github.com/kingbryan/getting-things-done) and hanging out on [Twitter](https://kingbryan.me)!!
