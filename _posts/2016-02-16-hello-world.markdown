Hi there. Welcome to my site. I'm Bryan, and I'll be your host for...well...FOREVER. Let me take a step back and introduce myself. I am an almost 23 year old front-end web developer living in Rochester, Michigan. A lot of people remember me as that guy with the beard. I'm cool with that, mainly cause my beard is awesome. Anyways, I've been doing this (making websites) professionally for about 9 months, with another year or so of playing around on the web.

What this here blog will cover...

Why I'm doing it
  become a better writer
  share my insights with the world
  share my successes
  share my failures
  learn a ton
  etc..
  ..
