Hi there! Welcome to my site. I'm Bryan, and I'll be your host for this evening (and beyond). Let me take a minute and introduce myself. I am an almost 23 year old front-end web developer living in Rochester, Michigan. I've been making websites as a professional for about 9 months at Flagstar Bank. Additionally, I have another year or so of experience playing around on the web for school and for fun.

Here, I will blog about my adventures making kick-ass stuff for the Internet. I like to design, develop, and think about business strategy. My writing will be a culmination of each of these topics. I find their intersection quite fascinating and would like to explore them as much as I can. I'm planning to write some long-form opinion pieces, tutorials, and general short-form journal entries. I am hoping I can do some relevant work that I can share here with you. There also might be some other cool stuff from my life sneaking in here, too!

In the past, I have struggled with this whole blogging thing. Right now, I am at a point in my career that I should have enough going on to support this habit. Between the lessons I learn at work (won't be able to get specific there) and the side projects I've been working on, there WILL be stuff to write about. My goal is to report here once a week to get me started.

Thanks for stopping by! I'm glad that you made it and hope to see you again soon!! Have a good one!
