Front-end developer (May 2015 - present)  
I am a member of the team in charge of the responsive redesign of flagstar.com. The first step towards the goal was an overhauled loans section, along with a brand new locator search, location pages, and contact form.
Our team worked closely with our internal designers and business partners to establish our responsive strategy for the entire site. We continue to push forward towards the ultimate goal of making the entire site responsive.

### My blog
No surprises here. I definitely created this monster. This is where I write my deepest, darkest thoughts. Oh wait, wrong place. For real though, I try super hard to become a better writer, and I do that here, reporting on my adventures making the world wide web. From the layout, colors and font choices all the way down to the letters that make up each post, I've poured countless hours into this thing. I hope that at some point, it'll be valuable to others.

### Today I Learned
TIL is a repo on GitHub where I document things I learn. Some are technical things I discovered for projects and some are just cool random facts I want to share and not forget. This practice is also helping me experiment with some workflow ideas that I hope to incorporate into my current habits.

### Getting things done
In an attempt to hold myself accountable for achieving goals, I have open-sourced my to-do list. Putting it out on the Internet where someone might come across it should keep me motivated to be productive during my free-time. Most of it is going to be related to side projects and my other learning endeavors. I also think it'll offer an opportunity for reflection down the line where I'll be able to see some of my growth.
