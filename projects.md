Front-end developer (May 2015 - present)  
I am a member of the team in charge of the responsive redesign of flagstar.com. The first step towards the goal was an overhauled loans section, along with a brand new locator search, location pages, and contact form.
Our team worked closely with our internal designers and business partners to establish our responsive strategy for the entire site. We continue to push forward towards the ultimate goal of making the entire site responsive.

### My blog
No surprises here. I definitely created this monster. This is where I write my deepest, darkest thoughts. Oh wait, wrong place. For real though, I try super hard to become a better writer, and I do that here, reporting on my adventures making the world wide web. From the layout, colors and font choices all the way down to the letters that make up each post, I've poured countless hours into this thing. I hope that at some point, it'll be valuable to others.

### Today I Learned
TIL is a repo on GitHub where I document things I learn. Some are technical things I discovered for projects and some are just cool random facts I want to share and not forget. This practice is also helping me experiment with some workflow ideas that I hope to incorporate into my current habits.

I've got a few things brewing on the side. Once I make enough progress to show them off, you'll see them featured here!
