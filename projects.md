### Flagstar Bank
Front-end developer (May 2015 - present)  

I am a member of the team responsible for the responsive redesign of flagstar.com. The first step towards the goal was an overhauled loans section, along with a brand new locator search, location pages, and contact form.
Our team worked closely with our internal designers and business partners to establish our responsive strategy for the entire site.

##### Today I Learned
TIL is a repo on GitHub where I document things I learn. Some are technical things I discovered for projects and some are just cool random facts I want to share and not forget. This practice is also helping me experiment with some workflow ideas that I hope to incorporate into my current habits.

##### More projects coming soon!
I've got a few things brewing on the side. Once I make enough progress to show them off, you'll see them featured here!
