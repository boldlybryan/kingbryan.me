I am a front-end web developer out of Rochester, Michigan. I've been working at Flagstar Bank for the past 9 months since I've graduated from college. I attended Oakland University and majored in Management Information Systems. Because I had very minimal training in development in my curriculum, I'm pretty much your average self-taught web developer at this point.

When I'm not working on website, I'm usually spending time with my beautiful fianc√©e, Katie. We nerd out a lot, she's into making websites and I would say it's something we really bond over. When we're not staring at computer screens we enjoy spending time outdoors: camping, hiking, biking and more.

I look forward to sharing my adventures with you here on my blog! Let's stay in touch: [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kingbryandotme) to see what I've been up to today!!
